# Vee Prototype

## Description

This is a prototype as per the instructions provided in the `assignment.pdf` file.
This repository houses both the **frontend** and the **backend**, just to make things a bit simpler.

## Base requirements

Make sure to have the following installed on your machine:

- [**node**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [**docker & docker-compose**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/installation)

After that, navigate to either the **frontend** or the **backend** folder and check out the respective `README.md` files there.
